career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have loved web development ever since. I have a passion for usability, and for creating functional, usable websites that are easy to use on the client admin end. 

    I started my own WordPress/PHP web development business in 2007, and most of my clients have been NGOs or small businesses that have all come to me through word-of-mouth.

    Currently, I use Twitter Bootstrap 4+ as a framework for WordPress theme front ends, and create or customize plugins according to client needs. I use SCSS/SASS, Git, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JQuery on a daily basis. 

    I also dabble in online advertising with Google AdWords. 

    Although my formal education was in Biochemistry (Immunology), I've discovered a love for web programming and data analytics (probably through my experience of Bioinformatics).

  - degree: BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry

      I help clients in all stages of their website needs, from registering and hosting a domain name, to installing and configuring WordPress. That's only a small part of my daily activity, though. My main activities are creating WordPress themes (currently using Bootstrap 4+ as a framework), and creating custom plugins to address specific client problems.

  assignments:
    - title: BokBus Garden Route Tours
      link: "https://www.bokbus.com"
      tagline: "This tour company needed a responsive site that allows people to book (and upgrade) their various Garden Route tours based on calendar availability. I built them a responsive WordPress template using Bootstrap 4 and Understrap. The site includes WooCommerce support and a rather complex booking system, translations into German, and the use of Advanced Custom Fields (AFC) for tour information."

    - title: Theatre 4 Youth
      link: "https://www.theatre4youth.co.za"
      tagline: "This was a really fun WordPress project to work on. This NGO bridges theatre with education, and their site needed several custom post types for Theatre Companies, Theatrical Productions, Schools, and Geographical Areas - modelling a relational database. They needed access control to certain information, and an interactive Google Map showing the location of registered schools and/or Theatre Companies. They also needed front-end submission of theatrical productions for registered users. This is probably one of my most interactive sites."

      link: "https://makerstation.co.za/"
