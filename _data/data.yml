career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have loved web development ever since. I have a passion for accessibility, and for creating functional, attractive websites that are easy to use on the client admin end.

    I started my own WordPress/PHP web development business in 2007, in South Africa, and most of my clients were NGOs or small businesses that came to me through word-of-mouth.

    In 2019, I moved to Ireland, and took a position with Appiercom, who were subsequently bought out by Ingenium TC.

    My current stack includes WordPress (both front and back-end, creating both themes and bespoke plugins), Twitter Bootstrap 4+, Divi and Genesis Pro as frameworks for WordPress themes, the WordPress API, various third-party REST APIs, SCSS/SASS, Git, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript/ECMAScript 6 and JQuery, MySQL.

    Although my formal education was in Biochemistry (Immunology), I've discovered a love for web programming and data analytics (probably through my experience of Bioinformatics).

education:
  - degree: BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry

  assignments:
    - title: Dochas Autism - http://www.dochasautism.ie/
      link: "https://dochasautism.ie"
      tagline: "This was a pro-bono project for a local charity that supports children with autism. The site was a WordPress site using the Divi page builder, and incorporated a complex online membership application, and an eCommerce solution that allows users to donate an amount of their choice, as either a once-off donation or as a recurring donation. Plugins included an automated backup solution, caching with CloudFlare, image and script optimisation and SSL support."

    - title: Ingenium Training and Consulting - https://www.ingeniumtc.com/
      link: "https://ingeniumtc.com"
      tagline: "This was a multi-company project, with external consultants engaged for both SEO optimisation of the text content, and a graphic design company for the overall look.

    - title: Theatre 4 Youth - https://www.theatre4youth.co.za
      link: "https://www.theatre4youth.co.za"

This NGO bridges theatre with education, and their site needed several custom post types for Theatre Companies, Theatrical Productions, Schools, and Geographical Areas - modelling a relational database. They needed access control to certain information, and an interactive Google Map showing the location of registered schools and/or Theatre Companies. They also needed front-end submission of theatrical productions for registered users. This is probably one of my most interactive sites. It was built using Bootstrap 3+, and later upgraded to Bootstrap 4+."
