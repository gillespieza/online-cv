  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have loved web development ever since. I have a passion for usability, and for creating functional, usable websites that are easy to use on the client admin end. 

    I started my own WordPress/PHP web development business in 2007, and most of my clients have been NGOs or small businesses that have all come to me through word-of-mouth.

    Currently, I use Twitter Bootstrap 4+ as a framework for WordPress theme front ends, and create or customize plugins according to client needs. I use SCSS/SASS, Git, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JQuery on a daily basis. 

    I also dabble in online advertising with Google AdWords. 

    Although my formal education was in Biochemistry (Immunology), I've discovered a love for web programming and data analytics (probably through my experience of Bioinformatics).

    These are some of my previous clients. They were mostly small businesses and NGOs, and sadly, not all of these businesses are still in existance. I am happy to provide screenshots of my work for businesses that no longer exist.
  assignments:
    - title: BokBus Garden Route Tours
      link: "https://www.bokbus.com"
      tagline: "This tour company needed a responsive site that allows people to book (and upgrade) their various Garden Route tours based on calendar availability. I built them a responsive WordPress template using Bootstrap 4 and Understrap. The site includes WooCommerce support and a rather complex booking system, translations into German, the use of Advanced Custom Fields for tour information."

    - title: Theatre 4 Youth
      link: "https://www.theatre4youth.co.za"
      tagline: "This was a really fun WordPress project to work on. This NGO bridges theatre with education, and their site needed several custom post types for Theatre Companies, Theatrical Productions, and Schools. They needed access control to certain information, and an interactive Google Map showing the location of registered schools and/or Theatre Companies. They also needed front-end submission of theatrical productions for registered users. This is probably one of my most interactive sites."

    - title: Encounters SA Documentary Film Festival
      link: "https://www.encounters.co.za"
      tagline: "A client who requires an annual site redesign. Artwork is provided by an external Graphic Designer, and I implement the design into a responsive WordPress theme. Custom Posts handle the Films, Guests and Guest Appearances. A complex film submission and paypal payment is handled using Gravity Forms."

    - title: Biophysics Workshop
      link: "https://biophysicsworkshop.co.za/"
      tagline: "This WordPress site is used by the Centre for Imaging and Analysis, at the University of Cape Town (South Africa), for advertising various courses and workshops. For each course, the design is changed to fit new sponsors and corporate branding requirements. Membership permissions are required for certain sections of the website, and the site includes a student forum."
