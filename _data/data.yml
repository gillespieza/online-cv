career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have never looked back. I am passionate about accessibility and good UX, and about creating functional, attractive websites that are easy for my clients to use.

    I started my own WordPress business in 2007, in South Africa, and most of my clients were NGOs or small businesses that came to me through word-of-mouth.

    In 2019, I moved to Ireland, and took a position with Appiercom, who were subsequently bought out by Ingenium TC.

    As a freelance business owner and senior WordPress developer, my role has been wide-ranging and diverse, but ultimately, I am responsible for the successful launch of my clients' websites. I am involved in every stage of a web project, from start to finish, including taking client specifications, conducting user research, managing stakeholder engagement, developing and implementing a solution for the client's specific requirements, designing something beautiful, conducting post-launch data analysis, recommending SEO optimisations and marketing improvements, monitoring for security and compliance issues, and making strategic recommendations to stakeholders. My role also included creating and managing project timelines, managing project scope, prioritising features for development, contributing to budgets/quotes, and writing tender applications.

    My current tech-stack includes WordPress (both front and back-end, creating both themes and bespoke plugins written with PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript/ECMAScript 6 and JQuery), Twitter Bootstrap 3+, 4+ and 5+, pagebuilders such as Divi and frameworks such as Genesis Pro for WordPress themes, the WordPress REST API, various third-party REST APIs, SCSS/SASS, Git, and MySQL. Project management is conducted via Jira.

education:
  - degree: BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry
    university: University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
    time: 2002

  - degree: BSc in Biochemistry and Animal Genetics
    university: University of Natal, South Africa
    time: 1999

experiences:
  - role: Senior WordPress Developer
    time: 2020 - Present
    company: Appiercom/Ingenium, Ireland
    details: |
      Note - *Appiercom was bought out by Ingenium in early 2021, but I list them here as one job, because from my perspective, the only thing that changed was the name printed on the payslip. Everything else (job, location, team), stayed the same following the acquisition.*

      **Responsible for maintenance of more than 20 WordPress websites, including the successful launch of more than 10 of those.**

      I design and implement beautiful WordPress websites, using either Twitter Bootstrap, a page builder such as Divi, or a Gutenburg block-based framework (such as the Genesis Pro Framework), as per client requirements. I am responsible for concept-to-completion of new web sites. I also create custom plugins to meet specific customer needs, and conduct regular maintenance and optimisation on our client websites. My duties include:
      - writing tender applications for public service requests
      - taking client specifications
      - conducting client onboarding workshops
      - conducting user research and user roadmapping
      - project management through Jira and Excel
      - prioritising features for development within a specified timeline

      - DNS management, including CloudFlare and email (DKIM, SPF) records
      - conducting in-person and online client training
      - creating video screencasts with voiceovers for client training

      Recently, my role expanded to include the company's mobile app projects. In this role, I am responsible for the creation and maintenance of apps created using the GoodBarber App Building platform. This role included all of the same project- and product-management tasks listed above, in addition to the design, data-capture and launch of a successfull mobile application, in PWA format, and in native iOS and Android formats.

    These are some of my previous clients. They were mostly small businesses and NGOs, and sadly, not all of these businesses are still in existence (especially after Covid). I am happy to provide screenshots of my work for businesses that no longer exist.
  assignments:
    - title: Dochas Autism - http://www.dochasautism.ie/
      link: "https://dochasautism.ie"
      tagline: "This was a pro-bono project for a local charity that supports children with autism. The site was a WordPress site using the Divi page builder, and incorporated a complex online membership application, and an eCommerce solution that allows users to donate an amount of their choice, as either a once-off donation or as a recurring donation. Plugins included an automated backup solution, caching with CloudFlare, image and script optimisation and SSL support."

    - title: SafeChoice Safety - https://www.safechoicesafety.com/
      link: "https://safechoicesafety.com"
      tagline: "This was a multi-company project, with external consultants engaged for both SEO optimisation of the text content, and a graphic design company for the overall look.

    - title: Theatre 4 Youth - https://www.theatre4youth.co.za
      link: "https://www.theatre4youth.co.za"
      tagline: "This was a really fun WordPress project to work on. This NGO bridges theatre with education, and their site needed several custom post types for Theatre Companies, Theatrical Productions, Schools, and Geographical Areas - modelling a relational database. They needed access control to certain information, and an interactive Google Map showing the location of registered schools and/or Theatre Companies. They also needed front-end submission of theatrical productions for registered users. This is probably one of my most interactive sites. It was built using Bootstrap 3+, and later upgraded to Bootstrap 4+."
