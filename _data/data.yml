  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have loved web development ever since. I have a passion for usability, and for creating functional, usable websites that are easy to use on the client admin end. 

    I started my own WordPress/PHP web development business in 2007, and most of my clients have been NGOs or small businesses that have all come to me through word-of-mouth.

    Currently, I use Twitter Bootstrap 4+ as a framework for WordPress theme front ends, and create or customize plugins according to client needs. I use SCSS/SASS, Git, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JQuery on a daily basis. 

    I also dabble in online advertising with Google AdWords. 

    Although my formal education was in Biochemistry (Immunology), I've discovered a love for web programming and data analytics (probably through my experience of Bioinformatics).
