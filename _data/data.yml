career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I built my first website in 2006, and I have loved web development ever since. I am passionate about accessibility, and creating functional, attractive websites that are easy for my clients to use.

    I started my own WordPress business in 2007, in South Africa, and most of my clients were NGOs or small businesses that came to me through word-of-mouth.

    In 2019, I moved to Ireland, and took a position with Appiercom, who were subsequently bought out by Ingenium TC.

    As a freelance business owner and senior WordPress developer, my role has been wide-ranging and diverse, but ultimately, I am responsible for the successful launch of my clients' websites. I am involved in every stage of a web project, from start to finish, including taking client specifications, conducting user research, managing stakeholder engagement, developing and implementing a solution for the client's specific requirements, designing something beautiful, conducting post-launch data analysis, recommending SEO optimisations and marketing improvements, and monitoring for security and compliance issues. My role also included creating and managing project timelines, contributing to budgets/quotes, and writing tender applications.

    My current tech-stack includes WordPress (both front and back-end, creating both themes and bespoke plugins written with PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript/ECMAScript 6 and JQuery), Twitter Bootstrap 3+ and 4+, pagebuilders such as Divi and frameworks such as Genesis Pro for WordPress themes, the WordPress REST API, various third-party REST APIs, SCSS/SASS, Git, and MySQL. Project management is conducted via Jira.

      link: "https://dochasautism.ie"
      tagline: "This was a pro-bono project for a local charity that supports children with autism. The site was a WordPress site using the Divi page builder, and incorporated a complex online membership application, and an eCommerce solution that allows users to donate an amount of their choice, as either a once-off donation or as a recurring donation. Plugins included an automated backup solution, caching with CloudFlare, image and script optimisation and SSL support."

      link: "https://ingeniumtc.com"

      link: "https://www.theatre4youth.co.za"
      tagline: "This was a really fun WordPress project to work on. This NGO bridges theatre with education, and their site needed several custom post types for Theatre Companies, Theatrical Productions, Schools, and Geographical Areas - modelling a relational database. They needed access control to certain information, and an interactive Google Map showing the location of registered schools and/or Theatre Companies. They also needed front-end submission of theatrical productions for registered users. This is probably one of my most interactive sites. It was built using Bootstrap 3+, and later upgraded to Bootstrap 4+."
